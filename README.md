# based-canvas [listener]

This branch is a good example of what happens when you abstract way too hard and
make a complicated mess out of everything.

Sometimes, doing it the messy simple way is the right way to go.

The example doesn't work and I'm not going to try to make it work.
I really hope I've learned my lesson but I doubt it.

If you're reading this, future me, let's just stick with imperative programming,
alright?
